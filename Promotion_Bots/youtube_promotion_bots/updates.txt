16-03-2025  Version 1 (youtube_promotion_bot_v1.py)
            - **Basic YouTube Monitoring**: Uses RSS feed parsing (`feedparser`) to detect new video uploads and live streams.
            - **Limited Storage**: Stores only the last detected video and live stream per channel.
            - **Basic Logging**: Logs bot activity using `logging` and `RotatingFileHandler`, but with minimal error reporting.
            - **No API Key Rotation**: Relies solely on RSS feed detection without making YouTube API calls.
            - **No Role-Based Access**: All users with access to the bot can run commands.
            - **Command Features**:
            - `/check_for_new_live_stream` – Checks for new live streams.
            - `/check_for_new_videos` – Checks for new video uploads.
            - `/add_channel` – Adds a YouTube channel to monitoring.
            - `/remove_channel` – Removes a monitored YouTube channel.
            - `/list_channels` – Lists monitored YouTube channels.
            - **Polling Interval**: Runs checks every 5 minutes, which may lead to delays in detecting new content.
23-03-2025 Version 2 (youtube_promotion_bot_v2.py)
           - **YouTube API Integration**: Uses `requests` to fetch video and stream details from the YouTube API, ensuring more accurate detection.
           - **API Key Rotation**: Implements multiple YouTube API keys and rotates them to avoid hitting quota limits.
           - **Expanded Storage**: Stores the last 10 videos and live streams per channel instead of just the last one.
           - **Rate Limiting**: Uses the `ratelimit` library to avoid exceeding API request limits.
           - **Improved Logging**: Logs API errors, quota issues, and bot actions in greater detail.
           - **Role-Based Access Control**: Introduces a permissions system, allowing only users with specific roles to execute certain commands.
           - **Command Enhancements**:
           - `/check_for_new_live_stream` – Now verifies live streams using the YouTube API.
           - `/check_for_new_videos` – Fetches recent video uploads more accurately.
           - `/add_youtube_channel` – Requires channel ID and name; bot fetches and confirms validity before adding.
           - `/remove_youtube_channel` – Removes a monitored YouTube channel.
           - `/list_youtube_channels` – Displays an embed listing all monitored channels.
           - **Background Tasks**:
           - Runs checks every 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes for near real-time monitoring.
           - Introduces a task to send daily logs to a designated Discord channel.
14-04-2025 Version 3 (youtube_promotion_bot_v3.py)
             - **Enhanced Logging and Debugging**:
             - Validates `.env` variables before the bot starts.
             - Logs quota limits and API request failures with more details.
           - **User Interface Enhancements**:
             - Introduces interactive buttons in Discord for watching videos and joining live streams.
             - Uses embeds to format command responses for better readability.
           - **Improved Command Handling**:
             - `/add_youtube_channel` now supports searching by channel name and confirming selection before adding.
             - `/list_youtube_channels` now displays search terms used when adding a channel.
             - `/set_youtube_bot_status` and `/set_youtube_bot_presence` provide additional customization for bot activity.
           - **Daily Log Reporting**:
             - Automatically generates and sends daily logs to a specified log channel.
             - Clears log files after each report to maintain organization.
           - **Optimized YouTube API Calls**:
            - Reduces unnecessary API requests by caching data.
            - Handles quota exhaustion by switching API keys dynamically.
           - **Configuration Management**:
            - Moves allowed roles and command permissions to a separate `config.json` file for easier modifications.
